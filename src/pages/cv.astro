        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Troy and Iâ€™m a student 3D artist studying on a BA
          (Hons) Game Arts and Design course in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019 I began experimenting with Blender after having used various
          2D art applications such as Adobe Photoshop for over 5 years. After
          making this change, I realised that I have a huge interest in creating
          3D graphics for video games and TV. At the moment I am working on
          expanding my skillset to encompass other areas with a focus on
          lighting and rendering techniques in relation to environment art.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current portfolio of work can be found on my website at:
          <a href="/projects">troylusty.com/projects</a>.

          My specific chosen area of focus is design, lighting, and rendering
          focusing on 3D environments within software such as Blender and Unreal
          Engine. Using either real-time or offline rendering techniques. In
          addition to this, I am also very interested in web development.
