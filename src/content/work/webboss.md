I joined WebBoss for a week as my work experience placement in Sixth Form. In my
time there I sat with the designers and developers observing the work they did
before going off to create my own designs. These designs were then later turned
into [templates](https://webboss.uk/ryman) that customers could use as a
launchpad when creating their own site. I used Adobe XD and Photoshop to create
the [designs](/projects/webboss) which turned out to be different to what the
rest of the team were using, however I was still able to fit into their team.
Upon completion of the week I was invited back to work further over the coming
holiday. _Reference: [Jake Smith](tel:01803467678)._
