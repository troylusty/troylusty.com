This post is a simple guide on how I "Librebooted" my Lenovo Thinkpad X230. I struggled to find instructions which detailed the entire process for a beginner who has never used tools such as flashrom before. The examples I have given here are based on what I did personally. Whilst these are the exact steps I took, for you there may be other or completely different steps so please reference the [documentation](https://libreboot.org/docs/install/x230_external.html) before carrying out any steps listed here.

**If you are unsure of what size rom you require, you can find this out by reading the data from each chip and checking the resulting files.**

In my case I used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, a Pomona SOIC Clip 8 Pin, and a minimum of 6 female jumper wires.

![Flashing the chips](flashing.avif)

Before starting remember to remove the laptop's battery. Some guides state that you should also disconnect the CMOS battery however I didn't. When connecting and disconnecting the SOIC clip, ensure that the Pi is not connected to power to avoid damaging the chip.

## Preparing the rom

1. Download Libreboot's build system.

```sh
git clone https://codeberg.org/libreboot/lbmk
```

2. [Download](https://libreboot.org/download.html) the rom from Libreboot.

_stable > 20230625 (or the latest folder for you) > roms > libreboot-20230625_x230_12mb.tar.xz_

3. Extract the downloaded tar archive. Inside _bin > x230_12mb_ pick the correct rom for your keyboard layout and whether you want to use GRUB or SeaBIOS.

4. Run the below command **from inside** the lbmk directory and point it to the rom you chose above. Put your devices MAC address after the _-m_ switch as shown. Mine was printed on a sticker located inside the machine.

```sh
./vendor inject -r grub_x230_12mb_libgfxinit_corebootfb_ukqwerty.rom -b x230_12mb -m 00:f6:f0:40:71:fd
```

5. Split the rom for flashing onto the two chips.

```sh
dd if=grub_x230_12mb_libgfxinit_corebootfb_ukqwerty.rom of=top.rom bs=1M skip=8
dd if=grub_x230_12mb_libgfxinit_corebootfb_ukqwerty.rom of=bottom.rom bs=1M count=8
```

## Flashing

1. Read the top chip 2 or 3 times into separate files and compare the outcome using _diff_. This ensures that the data received has no discrepancies.

```sh
sudo flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=32768 -r factory_bios_top_01.rom -c "MX25L3206E/MX25L3208E" -V
```

2. Read bottom chip 2 or 3 times and again compare the outcome.

```sh
sudo flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=32768 -r factory_bios_bottom_01.rom -c "MX25L6406E/MX25L6408E" -V
```

3. Flash the top chip.

```sh
sudo flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=32768 -w top.rom -c "MX25L3206E/MX25L3208E" -V
```

4. Flash the bottom chip.

```sh
sudo flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=32768 -w bottom.rom -c "MX25L6406E/MX25L6408E" -V
```

## Internal flashing to update Libreboot

1. Find flash chip size.

```sh
flashprog -p internal
```

2. If flashprog tells you '/dev/mem mmap failed: Operation not permitted' then use the following command.

```sh
sudo modprobe -r lpc_ich
```

3. Install flashprog and optionally dmidecode from the AUR.

```sh
paru -S flashprog dmidecode
```

4. Read the current chip contents several times. To do this, run the same command changing the dump.bin filename.

```sh
sudo flashprog -p internal:laptop=force_I_want_a_brick,boardmismatch=force -r dump.bin
```

5. Clone Libreboot MaKe and change into the directory.

```sh
git clone https://codeberg.org/libreboot/lbmk; cd lbmk
```

6. Run the dependencies installer script. The content of which can be found in: `config/dependencies/arch`, if using Arch Linux for example.

```sh
sudo ./build dependencies arch
```

7. Manually install missing dependencies listed at the end of the script.

```sh
paru -S bdf-unifont ttf-unifont # ttf-unifont was meant to be unifont
```

8. Run the injection script to patch the release rom with the necessary vendor files.

```sh
./vendor inject -r seabios_withgrub_x230_12mb_libgfxinit_corebootfb_ukqwerty_grubfirst.rom -b x230_12mb -m 00:f6:f0:40:71:fd
```

9. Erase and rewrite the chip contents with the new rom.

```sh
sudo flashprog -p internal:laptop=force_I_want_a_brick,boardmismatch=force -w seabios_withgrub_x230_12mb_libgfxinit_corebootfb_ukqwerty_grubfirst.rom
```

10. Identify and clean-up installed dependencies.

```sh
paru -Qe
```
