import deltakey from "deltakey.webm";
import wallpaperpeel from "wallpaperpeel.webm";

The outcome I went into this project expecting was that I would produce an environment made entirely from scratch which I could create a short test virtual production shot in utilising a motion capture camera rig and live keying. Later I would then properly composite the two bits of footage together.

**This project is presented here in the state it was upon the university deadline. There were a couple issues that occurred towards the end of production which is why the project is listed as incomplete.**

_Using Lumen for global illumination._

![Progress 4 for Digital Artefact: Corridor project](troy-lusty-highresscreenshot05012023-1.avif)

_Set the project to use deprecated hardware raytracing instead of Lumen, which resulted in the light spill on the walls being fixed._

_First steps of migrating the scene over to Unreal Engine. Focusing on recreating the lights from Blender into Lumen. I am having issues softening up the shadows being cast from the light shade and wall mounting._

_Modelled a new scene design by creating repeatable assets in Blender and utilising collection instancing._

_Initial idea made and presented in Blender for the project pitch._
