import nightmare from "nightmare.webm";

This is the environment I created in collaboration with Sam Griffiths for our Unit 8 - Developing a Creative Media Production Project - Final Major Project. I was in charge of the art side of the project including asset production, composition, and lighting although we both helped one another out when necessary with blueprints etc. Additionally, I created this short cinematic in Unreal Engine's cinematic level sequencer by keyframing the transform values and focus distance of a camera.

_IMPORTANT: I would just like to add that since we were taking heavy inspiration from both Little Nightmares and INSIDE, combined with the relatively short time window we had to create the playable demo in, we decided to take the main character model and player animations from Little Nightmares and put them into our project. This allowed for us to much more easily create the environment around the character's scale emphasising their small size in comparison to the surroundings._
