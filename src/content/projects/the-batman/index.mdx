This is my first attempt at combining footage from multiple different sources since I used both UE5 and Blender to create the two sequences. I used this piece as a way to experiment with various things I have never attempted before such as simple colour work and a lot of research into real-world cameras and emulating them in 3D. It was completed as part of my [UAL Level 3 Extended Diploma in Games and Interactive Media Year 2](https://www.arts.ac.uk/partnerships/ual-awarding-body/qualifications/creative-media/ual-level-3-diploma-and-extended-diploma-in-creative-media-production-and-technology) final major project.
