**This project was previously only a game jam submission but very soon it will be polished up and published onto [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3368860/Sinkie_Soldiers)!**

If you're interested in looking at our original [submission](https://troylusty.itch.io/sinkie-soldiers), it was done as a part of the [Ukie Student Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/ukie-student-game-jam-2024), in which the team consisted of myself and [Sam Griffiths](https://samgriffiths.dev). The jam ran for one day from 14 Mar 2024 9:00 AM to 15 Mar 2024 5:00 PM.

## Keep control of the castle, but more importantly: your armour.

Sinkie Soldiers is a local co-op versus game in which you battle against your friends for control of the castle! Your goal is to break down the integrity of your enemy's armour and finish them off to claim the victory.

The game is located on a kids bouncy castle play area and is based around what they might be imagining whilst playing there.
