## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.ts
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

The layout of directories and content should match Astro's own recommendations with components being found in `src/components/` for example.

Project and post articles are contained within MDX documents located in `src/content/`. This has been done to allow for videos to be embedded when they are also kept in the corresponding content directory.

## ðŸš§ Building

Docker is used to deploy the site to a VPS. Container images are built using a [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/docker.yml) from the included [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal.
